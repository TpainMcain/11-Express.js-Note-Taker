## Description
The Note Taker App is a web application built using Express, a popular web framework for Node.js. This app allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes, providing a convenient way to organize and manage personal or professional information.
* Create Notes: Users can easily create new notes by providing a title and the desired content. Each note is automatically assigned a unique identifier for easy retrieval and manipulation.
* View Notes: The app displays a list of all existing notes, allowing users to browse through their collection. Clicking on a specific note displays its title and content in a separate view.
* Update Notes: Users can modify the title or content of any existing note. This feature enables users to make changes to their notes whenever necessary.
* Delete Notes: Users can delete unwanted notes, removing them from the app's database and freeing up space for new notes.
